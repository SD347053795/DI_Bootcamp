        "1. Getting the Data: I would start by collecting data from the financial institution. This includes details about the loan applicants, like their income, age, and job history, as well as their loan history, such as how much they borrowed and whether they paid it back on time.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Looking at the Data:  I would carefully examine the data to spot any missing or strange values. I would fix any issues, like filling in missing information or removing outliers that don’t make sense.\n",
        "Then, I would explore the data to see how different factors relate to each other. For example, I would check if people with higher incomes are less likely to miss loan payments.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Creating Useful Information: Sometimes the existing data isn’t enough, so I would create new features that could help. For example, I might calculate a debt-to-income ratio to understand how much debt someone has compared to their income.I would also make sure all the data is in a format that the model can use, like converting text categories (such as \"employed\" or \"unemployed\") into numbers.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Choosing a Model:  I would select a few different machine learning algorithms that might work well for predicting whether someone will default on their loan. I consider simple options like Logistic Regression or more complex ones like Random Forests or Neural Networks.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Training the Model: I split the data into a training set and a testing set. The training set is used to teach the model, and the testing set is for checking how well the model learned. Then train the model with the training data and fine-tune it to ensure it doesn’t just memorize the data but can generalize well to new data.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Testing the Model: I would use the testing set to evaluate how well the model predicts loan defaults. I would check its accuracy and see if it correctly identifies who might default. I would then compare different models to determine which one performs best.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. Understanding the Model: Once I have a model that works well, I would try to understand its decisions. I then would look at which factors are most important in predicting defaults, like whether someone’s income or past loan history plays a bigger role.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. Using the Model: I would deploy the model by integrating it with the financial institution’s system, so it can help in making loan decisions.\n",
        "I would then monitor how the model performs over time, updating it when necessary to keep it accurate.\n"
